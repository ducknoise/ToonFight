=========

A game I made in my first year programming class. 
Each player could make his own character, assigning attributes and choosing 'move pools'.
At the beginning of each game, player would get random moves from move pool and players could fight other people's toons-each move pools have a selection of moves.
There are 4 move pools, 
1. mana - strengthened by intellect
2. energy - strengthened by agility
3. rage - strengthened by strength
4. luck - strengthened by nothing specifically
